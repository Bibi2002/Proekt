         <h3>HIP-HOP DANCES</h3>
            <p class="card-text"> This dance style is a mixture of the dance cultures of the African and American continents. The history of hip-hop as a dance began in America in the poorest neighborhood of African Americans and Latinos, in the South Bronx in the early 1970s.

                Initially, this style was just entertainment for unemployed migrants, then it grew into a way to express their individuality, show themselves and take root in their dance style. More and more often, competitions began to be arranged between dancers, which subsequently began to gather a large audience, because it was very spectacular and incendiary.</p>
