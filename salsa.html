     <h3>Salsa Lessons: Unleash and Develop</h3>
        <p class="card-text">For body
            Salsa lessons develop body flexibility, posture and gait. This is a gentle aerobic exercise.
            For the spirit
            In salsa lessons, we don't just teach movements and shapes. We pay great attention to the ability to be psychologically liberated, to be distracted from everyday problems and to express ourselves in dance.
            If you have a sincere desire, you can learn to move freely to Latin American rhythms in a matter of months. True, for this it is not enough just to download a couple of video tutorials and rehearse yourself in front of the mirror. At a minimum, a partner is needed, at a maximum, a group of like-minded people and an experienced teacher. All this you can get in the "Dance Studio" dance club! We are waiting for you every day!

At the same time, there are no permanent partners in it, this is entertainment for free and non-jealous natures. He leads, she follows and decorates. It is important to dance this dance easily and naturally, therefore, even in the process of learning salsa, it is customary to constantly change partners in order to learn to feel any “partner”.
